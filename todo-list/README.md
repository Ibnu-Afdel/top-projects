Here's a simple `README.md` file for your Todo List project. This will help you document your project and make it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the structure and features.

# Todo List App

A simple Todo List application built with vanilla JavaScript. This app allows users to create, update, delete, and organize todos by projects. The app supports persistence through `localStorage`, meaning the todos will be saved even if the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add new todos**: You can create new todos with a title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Edit todos**: Update the details of an existing todo.
- **Delete todos**: Remove todos from the list.
- **Filter and search**: Search for todos by title and filter them by priority or due date.
- **Manage projects**: Organize todos into different projects.
- **Persistence**: All todos and projects are saved in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd todo-list-app
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to run the app.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The main programming language used to create the application logic.
- **HTML**: The markup language for the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styles the app to make it user-friendly and responsive.

## Features to Add

- **Date Filtering**: Filter todos by specific due dates.
- **Priority Sorting**: Sort todos by priority (high, medium, low).
- **Local Storage**: Ensure todos persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- **User Authentication** (Optional): Allow multiple users to create and manage their own todo lists.
